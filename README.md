# C++ Fundamentals Projects

This repository contains a collection of basic C++ projects and assignments I built while learning the fundamentals of the language. Each project focuses on a different concept or feature of C++, ranging from basic syntax and control structures to object-oriented programming and memory management. The goal of this folder is to serve both as a learning archive and a demonstration of my understanding of the core C++ concepts.

## Overview

The projects in this folder were created as part of my journey to master the basics of C++. They are structured as standalone programs, each dealing with a specific topic or concept. All code is written in standard C++ and can be compiled with any modern C++ compiler.


## Project Structure

Each subfolder in this directory contains:

- A `.cpp` source file or files for the assignment and the `.hh` header file or files associated with it
- A brief description (as comments in the code)
